  - We came across many project ideas while brainstorming, but this one caught our attention the most. The league of legends contains many of the information such as runes, items, skill order that will be determined by the champion you select and it’s over 9,000!!! hundreds of champions that you can choose and we only have a short period of time to deal with every stuff above.
As you can see it will be hard for new players as well as the intermediate ones. Our goal is to make a website that provides a quick guide for the combination of everythings that we have mentioned.
Websites such as OP.GG or Mobalytics have very in-depth information about the games, but we think it is too advanced for most casual players and new players to keep up with the vast amount of information they provide in the short time period while we play the game itself.
Note: We as players mostly multi-task between gathering data and playing the game at the same time, so it would be excellent if the data visualization is easily understandable and responsive to quickly provide the information we need.
This project will increase our experience to do other projects in the future. Beside this project can gain some profit from advertising, Being an official web base model, If our project deployed successfully. It will solve the problem for newbies that do not know about the league of legend that causes good game experience. We also have a donation feature for users to support us for next web development in the future.

   When we try to find information about this game while playing it, the websites we found aren't easy to understand at first glance. It took time studying what the numbers on their pages meant, and that’s what we think could be the actual reason why many players do not know what to do in the game and eventually cause their team to collapse most of the time, so we decided to make a greater application that would represent the data they needed as simple as possible but still contains most of the valuable information for their gameplay.
